				Oasis were an English rock band formed in Manchester in 1991. Originally
				known as the Rain, the group initially consisted of Liam Gallagher (lead
				vocals, tambourine), Paul Arthurs (guitar), Paul McGuigan (bass guitar)
				and Tony McCarroll (drums). Liam's older brother Noel (lead guitar,
				vocals) later joined as a fifth member, finalising the group's core
				lineup. During the course of their existence, they had various lineup
				changes, with the Gallagher brothers remaining the only staple members.
				Oasis signed to independent record label Creation Records in 1993 and
				released their record-setting debut album Definitely Maybe (1994). The
				following year they recorded (What's the Story) Morning Glory? (1995)
				with drummer Alan White, in the midst of a chart rivalry with peers
				Blur. Spending ten weeks at number one on the UK Albums Chart, (What's
				the Story) Morning Glory? was also an international chart success and
				became one of the best-selling albums of all time. In addition, it
				stands as the fifth-best-selling album in the UK and the biggest-selling
				album in the UK of the 1990s. The Gallagher brothers featured regularly
				in tabloid newspapers for their disputes and wild lifestyles. In 1996,
				Oasis performed two nights at Knebworth for an audience of 125,000 each
				time, the largest outdoor concerts in UK history at the time. In 1997,
				Oasis released their third album, Be Here Now. It became the
				fastest-selling album in UK chart history. Oasis' popularity later
				declined and McGuigan and Arthurs left in 1999 as Oasis released
				Standing on the Shoulder of Giants (2000). They were replaced by former
				Heavy Stereo guitarist Gem Archer and former Ride guitarist Andy Bell.
				White departed in 2004, replaced by Zak Starkey and later Chris Sharrock
				as touring members. Oasis released three more studio albums, Heathen
				Chemistry (2002), Don't Believe the Truth (2005) and Dig Out Your Soul
				(2008). The group abruptly disbanded after the departure of Noel
				Gallagher in August 2009. As of 2009, Oasis had sold over 70 million
				records worldwide.[1][2] They are among the most successful acts on the
				UK Singles Chart and Albums Chart, with eight UK number-one singles and
				eight UK number-one albums.[3][4][5] The band also achieved three
				platinum albums in the US. They won 17 NME Awards, nine Q Awards, four
				MTV Europe Music Awards and six Brit Awards, including one in 2007 for
				Outstanding Contribution to Music and one for the "Best Album of the
				Last 30 Years" for (What's the Story) Morning Glory?. They were
				nominated for two Grammy Awards.[6] Oasis were an English rock band
